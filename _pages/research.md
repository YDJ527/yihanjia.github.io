My research primarily focuses on <strong>immersive media </strong>and <strong>positive media psychology</strong>. Specifically, I look at how certain features of immersive media (e.g., <strong>video games </strong>and <strong>virtual reality</strong>) influence peopleâ€™s perception and cognitive processing in the virtual environment, and how it leads to short-term and long-term effects. 

In addition to media psychology, I also have strong research interests in <strong>online communities</strong>. Specifically, I seek to answer how certain online communities are formed, and how they function and sustain using <strong>computational methods</strong>. My most recent publication looks at how parasocial relationship and interaction on the streaming platform <em>Twitch</em> lead to viewers' sense of community and thus contribute to overall community health.
