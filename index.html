<p>Hi, I am Yihan Jia, a Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://www.bu.edu/com/academics/emerging-media-studies/" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">Division of Emerging Media Studies at Boston University</a>. Iâ€™m also a graduate affiliate of the <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/crc/" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">Communication Research Center</a>.</p>
<p>My research is at the intersection of <strong>immersive media</strong>, <strong>positive media psychology</strong>, and <strong>neuroscience</strong>. I delve into how features of immersive media impact our <strong>behavioral</strong>, <strong>cognitive</strong>, and <strong>physiological</strong> responses, exploring both short-term and long-term effects. I employ an interdisciplinary set of methodological approaches, combining experiments, computational modeling, psychophysiological biometrics, big data analytics, and machine learning techniques. My recent projects have concentrated on applying machine learning approaches to biometric data to predict the memory recall of past media use, particularly in relation to narrative content within immersive media platforms.<p>

<p>In addition to media psychology, I also have strong research interests in <strong>online communities</strong>. Specifically, I seek to answer how certain online communities are formed, and how they function and sustain using <strong>computational methods</strong>. My most recent publication looks at how parasocial relationship and interaction on the streaming platform <em>Twitch</em> lead to viewers' sense of community and thus contribute to overall community health. </p>
<p>I obtained my M.S. and B.A. degrees in mass communication/media studies from the <a href="https://cla.purdue.edu/communication/" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue University</a>. I have interned and worked for Purdue LGBTQ Center and New Oriental Education & Technology Group. Outside academia, I enjoy photography (portfolio <a href="https://yihanjia.github.io/photography" style="color:DarkBlue;text-decoration: none">here</a>), chorus singing, and music composing. </p>
